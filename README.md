In this file, one problem is about dropping rows that are not duplicates. Just can't figure out what has been wrong in the code or data that leads to such mistake. Hence, it's impossible to apply these codes to replace work in excel.

### To_Dealer
Get stuck in final selection of non-duplicates. Don't understand why the returned index is larger than the total number of rows in all_data_clean.
